# my fix 

1. proptype: fixed

2. No input sanitization
i was using input directly from props and user without checking or cleaning it,if position is "malicious-class'; alert('xss')" then this will be added in <div className={`timeline-content ${position || ''}`} 
fix: created valid prop check in proptype.js so props from this only will be added now doing this can not add dangerous values if values is not in the valid prop it will be empty string ""

3. Poor Error Boundaries
 ISSUE: No semantic HTML or ARIA 
fix : added required semantic tags section and aside

4. CSS Class Injection Vulnerability
CURRENT ISSUE:
<div className={`timeline-content ${position || ''}`}>
fix : checked safe posotions and now passing as class name

5. No Default Props
// ISSUE: Missing fallbacks
const TimelineContent = ({ children, position }) => {
  // position could be undefined

fix : added default positions

6. Poor Component API
// ISSUE: Limited reusability
const TimelineContent = ({ children, position }) => {

// FIXED: More flexible API
const TimelineContent = ({
  children,
  position = 'left',
  variant = 'default',
  size = 'medium',
  className = '',
  ...rest
}) => {

fix : added more api to the components

7. No Props Spreading
// ISSUE: Can't pass HTML attributes
<div className={`timeline-content ${position || ''}`}>

fix : ...rest is added now to the classname to add html attributes

8. String Concatenation Issues
// ISSUE: Messy class handling
className={`timeline-content ${position || ''}`}

fix : class name is now handled properly by const classes = ['timeline-content', position].filter(Boolean).join(' ');

9. No Performance Optimization
// ISSUE: No memoization
React.memo is added to the components. now component which has chnages alone will render this avoids unneccesary rerender

10. No Responsive Design 
fix : added responsiveness using media query for responsiveness

11. Unnecessary DOM Node Creation
// ISSUE: Extra wrapper div serves no purpose
<div className={`timeline-content ${position || ''}`}>
  <div>{children}</div> // Unnecessary wrapper
</div>

fix :  unwanted div wrapper is now removed

12. String Concatenation on Every Render
// PERFORMANCE ISSUE: Template literal recreated each render
className={`timeline-content ${position || ''}`}

fix : fixed by adding usememo

13. No Controlled/Uncontrolled State Handling
i was handling set mode in app.jsx for mode chnage in label variant 
const [mode, setMode] = useState('left'); here if i am not passing initial left value then the timeline uses its own state this is fixed now.
handled internal state as fallback uncontrolled state is now handled
